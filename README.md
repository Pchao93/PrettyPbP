PrettyPbP
======

PrettyPbP is a better way to go over play by play data for the NBA. [Traditional views](https://stats.nba.com/game/0021700833/playbyplay/), while perfect for statisticians, strip away a sense of pace and flow for the typical fan. PrettyPbP aims to provide a visually appealing play-by-play record for fans that mimics the actual timeline of the game.

NOTE: As of late 2017, the NBA has chosen to restrict access to their API from the majority of server providers. Until this decision has changed, PrettyPbP can be run locally from your own machine by cloning the repo and running "npm install" and "npm start"
